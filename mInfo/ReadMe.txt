TODO Need to do a better recording on the audio to sweeten it, make timing and volume more consistent. It sounds bad because I recorded on a headphone mic as a test so next version will be a nice microphone.
TODO add volume control
TODO Review code and refactor when the game is released and python API and or shared memory is ver 1.0 clean up some of the code to be more efficent.
TODO add more features, fuel report, temp warnings, tire temp warnings
