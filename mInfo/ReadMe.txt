TODO Need to do a better recording on the audio to sweeten it, make timing and volume more consistent. It sounds bad because I recorded on a headphone mic as a test so next version will be a nice microphone.
TODO clean up some of the code to be more efficent. Add ability for config fie to remember settings.
TODO add additional languages and voice sets and volume control
TODO Review code and refactor when the game is released and python API and or shared memory is ver 1.0
TODO Perhaps add more features, report other drivers times, fuel report, temp warnings, average speed, lap countdowns  etc
