TODO add volume control
TODO Laptime add alert when new best lap achieved
TODO Fuel add ability to alert at lap finish or when fuel reaches set amount
TODO Need to do a better recording on the audio to sweeten it, make timing and volume more consistent. It sounds bad because I recorded on a headphone mic as a test so next version will be a nice microphone.
TODO Splits ahead or behind last split
TODO add more features, temp warnings, tires
TODO Review code and refactor when the game is released and python API and or shared memory is ver 1.0
